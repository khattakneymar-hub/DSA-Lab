Student Performance Analytics System

This project reads student records from a file and stores them
using a singly linked list with dynamic memory allocation.

Two sorting algorithms are used:
1. Bubble Sort – ranking students by CGPA
2. Insertion Sort – sorting students by enrollment year

The program generates multiple formatted output files
based on different analytical requirements.

How to Run:
1. Run generate_data.cpp to create students_data.txt
2. Run student_analysis.cpp to generate output files
